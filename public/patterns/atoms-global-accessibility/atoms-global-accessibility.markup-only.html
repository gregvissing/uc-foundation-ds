<p>Our brand's primary colors, red and black, have been meticulously selected to meet accessibility color guidelines. As such, it's crucial to adhere to their intended use. Never use red on black or black on red, as these combinations fail to meet the necessary color contrast requirements.</p>
<p>Using red on black or black on red not only compromises the legibility of your content but also goes against the principles of accessibility, potentially excluding individuals with visual impairments. These colors have been purposefully chosen to strike the right balance, ensuring that our brand is not only visually appealing but also inclusive for all. Please refrain from making any adjustments to these color combinations, as they are fundamental to maintaining our commitment to accessibility and brand integrity.</p>
