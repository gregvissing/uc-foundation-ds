    "description": "In addition to our bold primary colors, we introduce two secondary colors: UC Dark Red and Grey. These colors play vital roles in our brand's visual identity. UC Dark Red can be found accenting uc.edu websites, often used in subheaders or as a dynamic hover state when paired with UC Primary Red in digital formats. Grey, on the other hand, serves as a versatile background color, providing a necessary contrast to our primary red and black hues, all while maintaining our accessibility standards. These secondary colors enhance the depth and diversity of our brand's visual language."
